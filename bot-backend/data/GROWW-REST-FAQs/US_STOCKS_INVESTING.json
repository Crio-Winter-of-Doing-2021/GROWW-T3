This gives investors  the ability to trade any fraction or dollar value in a listed company. \n\nFor example, you can purchase Amazon shares worth $50 or buy 0.05 shares of Apple, as per your convenience. \n\nOur broker partner allows you to invest as little as 0.0001 shares of any stock.\n\nYou can also have a more balanced portfolio with a combination of number of fullshares and fraction based holdings.\n",
